Portfolio with Notion. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com).

## What is this?

This repo is my source code of my portfolio site, also an example of notion blog powered by Next.js and Notion API.

The design and structure might not be the best fit for you. You may focus on how I render the data into Next.js.

Completed guide is on [Medium](https://medium.com/@IamMrandrew). Coming soon.

## Getting Started

First create a `.env.local` with the following secrets.

```
NOTION_API_KEY="your_notion_api_key"
NOTION_DATABASE_ID="your_work_database_id"
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
